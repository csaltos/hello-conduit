# Response Either How ?

At the file app/Main.hs you may found an HTTP with an either response
but the match cases are not as simple as Left and Right.

What are the match cases to use ?

## Notes

* This code is based on the HTTP Conduit tutorial at https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md

* The type of the response and source code can be found at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-conduit-2.3.8/docs/Network-HTTP-Simple.html#v:httpJSONEither

Thank you for your help !!
